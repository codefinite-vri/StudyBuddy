# StudyBuddy
A study resource management system solely created to relieve students of the baggage they carry due to exam stress and pressure. Course resources are available in plenty, but are all of them helpful? StudyBuddy is a system wherein teachers upload what they think will be helpful to the students - notes, textbooks, assignments, question papers and much more.
