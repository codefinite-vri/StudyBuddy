# StudyBuddy  - Study Resource Management System

Study Resource Management System is a portal created to facilitate easy distribution of notes and assignments between faculty and students. The resources can either contain reference books, customized notes, or even assignments or question papers. The resources are identified based on their author, the subject they relate to, or the semester to which that particular subject belongs. The privilege of uploading any new resource into the database is given only to the faculty, and they can do so only after logging in. A normal user does not need to log in into the system to use it. They can perform a search and obtain the required resource. However, they are not authorized to insert, update or delete any records or resources from the system. The Admin is only allowed to make changes to faculty or anyone who is authorized to upload and edit resources.
